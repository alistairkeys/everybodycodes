# Everybody Codes

## What is this?
This repository has solutions to questions in https://everybody.codes/, which
is a coding challenge similar to Advent of Code, where there are a series of
multi-part questions and you're challenged to solve them.

## How do I build this?
The answers are in [Nim](https://nim-lang.org), so make sure you have it
installed (there are instructions on the Nim website).

Each question is a simple .nim file without dependencies, so you can execute
them by changing to the relevant directory and using `nim c -r question1.nim`
(for example).

## Why are the input files not provided?
In Advent of Code, they suggest you shouldn't do this. I've followed the same
principle for this.

## Why have you not solved every question?
I intend to work on this when I get the urge and am not taking it too
seriously. :)
